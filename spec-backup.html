                        <p class='quote'>We can bridge the communication gap by communicating intent, getting different roles involved in nailing down the requirements and exploiting the relationships between tests, examples and requirements. We can use realistic examples consistently throughout the project to avoid the translation and minimise the effect of the telephone game*, saving information from falling through the communication gaps. In order to ensure that the initial set of examples is good enough for development and testing, programmers and testers have to get involved in defining them. The discussion about these examples builds up a shared understanding of the domain, flushing out small communication problems straight from the start<span>- Gojko Adzic - Bridging the Communication Gap</span></p>

                        <p>Classical project requirements focus on what but not on why. These are called Imperative requirements, and they are effectively a proposed solution to a problem without investigating what the problem actually is. They give a false
                            impression of an exacting specification. Lets look at Dan North’ classic example of withdrawing cash from an ATM:</p>
                        <p>An imperative requirement might be:</p>
                        <p>Account holders can withdraw money from the machine and have their account debited appropriately </p>
                        <p>Lets contrast this with specifying examples:</p>

                        <p>Story: Account Holder withdraws cash</p>

                        <span>As an Account Holder
I want to withdraw cash from an ATM
So that I can get money when the bank is closed
 
Scenario 1: Account has sufficient funds
Given the account balance is \$100
 And the card is valid
 And the machine contains enough money
When the Account Holder requests \$20
Then the ATM should dispense \$20
 And the account balance should be \$80
 And the card should be returned
 
Scenario 2: Account has insufficient funds
Given the account balance is \$10
 And the card is valid
 And the machine contains enough money
When the Account Holder requests \$20
Then the ATM should not dispense any money
 And the ATM should say there are insufficient funds
 And the account balance should be \$20
 And the card should be returned </span>
                        <p>After reading these can you think of other examples? Of course you can! Reading examples stimulates your brain and thats a natural process. What about using different debits and limits? when withdrawal take account over overdraft
                            facilities? What should happen around boundaries? Should the machine ever retain the card? ...</p>

                        <p> Realistic examples make us think harder and leave far less chance for misunderstanding. It becomes easier to spot gaps, missed cases and inconsistencies. </p>

                        <p>Seems a bit more work upfront! It is</p>
                        <p>Maybe better to do this at reqs stage rather than unrooting real problems late when they're multiples of the cost to fix though? You’re getting the hang of this..</p>

                        <p>Also, we'll want to automate these examples. For a computer to run them they need to be exact.</p></div></div>

                        <p>User stories provide a high level plan and facilitate discussion, but they do not specify any details. Agile acceptance tests, on the other hand, provide specification details but do not even try to put things into a wider perspective.
