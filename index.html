               <p>We provide test architecture and oversight. We are great simpifiers. We can manage your testing. We work in context as part of your team. We help remove project noise. We give you the real picture. We write behavioural automated tests. We are flexible. We refine requirements. We are your assurance. We are leaner than the others. We are collaborative. We are technically versatile. We can be your testing core. We know its about business not code. We can help you build profitable software</p>

               <h2 class="section_title"> Scope 1</h2>
               <p>The role of a story: ..from this they can agree a common definiton of “done”, and we escape the dual gumption traps of “that’s not what I asked for” or “I forgot to tell you about this other thing”</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2 class="section_title"> Scope 2</h2>
               <p>You know your business, but what's the particular business problem you want to solve with this application? What are the essential goals?</p>
               
               <p>Only once we define scope from goals can we start defining requirements with confidence. If scoping is not done right, the rest may be a waste of time. </p>

               <h2 class="section_title"> Scope 3</h2>
               <p>Successful teams seek knowledge about the true nature of the problem and then collaborate to design solutions.</p>
               <p>We can help facilitate project members coming to a shared understanding of what the target is, even if it moves. </p>

               <h2 class="section_title">Requirements</h2>
               <p>The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding what to build*</p>

<p>Who in your project is verifying that you are actually building the right thing? The product your users actually want.</p>

<p>At their most basic, requirements are the basis of any specification. All systems are defined loosely by their requirements, whether or not they are documented. </p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2 class="section_title">Behavioural 1</h2>
               <p>Everything is vague to a degree you do not realise till you have tried to make it precise*</p>

<p>This is where loose definitions get tight. We define your expected behaviours by specifying them as examples. As scenarios. </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2 class="section_title">Behavioural 2</h2>
               <p>This involves explicitly specifying all the behaviours of your system exactly. As many as it takes.</p>

<p>We encourage deliberate use of common terms for specific entities and actions within the application (and the domain).</p>

<p>What falls out of this process as a natural by-product is a 'ubiquitous language', tech and stakeholders deriving common understanding of what application-related terms mean. This creates a virtuous cycle of improving communication and clarity.</p>
