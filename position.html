                    <p>The testing world is big. There’s a lot of confusion around <span class="smaller">testing so here’s a</span> <span class="darkgray">(3 minute read)</span> primer. </p>
                    <p>We also want you to know where we sit in the testing world:</p>
                    <div class="row imgs_wrapper">

                    </div>
                    <p>Its a brake release spring from a bike. Its small but important because it releases the brake when you release the lever (stops the bike stopping!). You could say its a unit because it has no smaller parts. Its not dependent on any other parts and its easily tested in isolation</p>
                    <div class="row vertical_wrapper">
                    <div class="col-sm-6 vertical_block">
                        <img src="imgs/position2.jpeg" alt="Position 2" />

                        <p>Put under specified tension and release</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                    <p>Unit tests verify individual components of a complex system. A unit can be tested independently of the other parts of that system. These tests are cool because they let us know whether each of the the small parts of a system work in isolation. Unit tests are best written by developers because they are close to the code. The tests can be run quickly and efficiently by computers so its good to have many of them</p>

                        <p>Any given system has lots of components. There’ll likely be components within components, and there will certainly be joining of components. These‘ll need testing. You may also hear these referred to as functional tests. Integration tests are component tests involving interfaces</p>
